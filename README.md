# 🛠️ Projects

This repository serves as a personal collection of all my coding projects — from automation tools and small utilities to practice-based applications and learning experiments.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Organize and track my development progress over time
- Showcase projects I've built while learning different technologies
- Keep code modular and readable for sharing or future updates

## 📁 Structure

Each project is maintained in its own subfolder with:

- Source code (`.py`, `.js`, etc.)
- A `README.md` for project-specific documentation
- Optional `.gitignore` for environment-specific files
- Additional files like configurations, resources, or compiled binaries (excluded where appropriate)

## 🔒 Note

Some projects may reference local-only config files (e.g., `mapping.json`) which are **excluded from version control** to protect privacy or environment-specific settings.

Feel free to explore each folder to see what I've been building!
